    "data_description": "A mammogram is an X-ray procedure used to check for breast cancer. Whether mammograms should be used is part of a controversial discussion, and it's the topic of our next example where we learn about 2-proportion hypothesis tests when H0 is p1 = p2. A 30-year study was conducted with nearly 90,000 female participants. During a 5-year screening period, each woman was randomized to one of two groups: in the first group, women received regular mammograms to screen for breast cancer, and in the second group, women received regular non-mammogram breast cancer exams. No intervention was made during the following 25 years of the study, and we'll consider death resulting from breast cancer over the full 30-year period. Results from the study are in mammogram.csv.\n\nIf mammograms are much more effective than non-mammogram breast cancer exams, then we would expect to see additional deaths from breast cancer in the control group. On the other hand, if mammograms are not as effective as regular breast cancer exams, we would expect to see an increase in breast cancer deaths in the mammogram group.",

This idea takes advantage of US compulsory attendance law. Usually, they state that a kid must have turned 6 years by January 1 of the year they enter school. For this reason, kids that are born at the beginning of the year will enter school at an older age. Compulsory attendance law also requires students to be in school until they turn 16, at which point they are legally allowed to drop out. The result is that people born later in the year have, on average, more years of education than those born in the beginning of the year.",

    "data_description": "Two social science researchers examined the impact of raising the minimum wage on employment in the fast-food industry. In 1992, the state of New Jersey (NJ) in the United States raised the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. Did such an increase in the minimum wage reduce employment as economic theory predicts? As discussed above, answering this question requires inference about the NJ employment rate in the absence of such a raise in the minimum wage. Since this counterfactual outcome is not observable, we must somehow estimate it using observed data.\nOne possible strategy is to look at another state in which the minimum wage did not increase. For example, the researchers of this study chose the neighboring state, Pennsylvania (PA), on the grounds that NJ\u2019s economy resembles that of Pennsylvania, and hence the fast-food restaurants in the two states are comparable. Under this cross-section comparison design, therefore, the fast-food restaurants in NJ serve as the treatment group receiving the treatment (i.e., the increase in the minimum wage), whereas those in PA represent the control group, which did not receive such a treatment. To collect pretreatment and outcome measures, the researchers surveyed the fast-food restaurants before and after the minimum wage increase. Specifically, they gathered information about the number of full-time employees, the number of part-time employees, and their hourly wages, for each restaurant.\n\nThe CSV file minwage.csv contains this data set.\nVariable Description\nchain: name of the fast-food restaurant chain\nlocation: location of the restaurants (centralNJ, northNJ, PA, shoreNJ, southNJ)\nwageBefore: wage before the minimum-wage increase\nwageAfter: wage after the minimum-wage increase\nfullBefore: number of full-time employees before the minimum-wage increase\nfullAfter: number of full-time employees after the minimum-wage increase\npartBefore: number of part-time employees before the minimum-wage increase\npartAfter: number of part-time employees after the minimum-wage increase",

Did such an increase in the minimum wage reduce employment as economic theory predicts? As discussed above, answering this question requires inference about the NJ employment rate in the absence of such a raise in the minimum wage. Since this counterfactual outcome is not observable, we must somehow estimate it using observed data.\nOne possible strategy is to look at another state in which the minimum wage did not increase. For example, the researchers of this study chose the neighboring state, Pennsylvania (PA), on the grounds that NJ\u2019s economy resembles that of Pennsylvania, and hence the fast-food restaurants in the two states are comparable.
